Installation

Usage
-----

slack-pull-reminder is configured using environment variables:

Required
~~~~~~~~

-  ``SLACK_API_TOKEN``
-  ``GITHUB_API_TOKEN``
-  ``ORGANIZATION``: The GitHub organization you want pull request
   reminders for.

Optional
~~~~~~~~

-  ``IGNORE_WORDS``: A comma-separated list of words that will cause a pull request to be ignored.

-  ``REPOSITORIES``: A comma-separated list of repository names to check, where all other repositories in the organization are ignored. All repositories are checked by default.

-  ``USERNAMES``: A comma-separated list of GitHub usernames to filter pull requests by, where all other users are ignored. All users in the organization are included by default.

-  ``SLACK_CHANNEL``: The Slack channel you want the reminders to be posted in, defaults to #general.

-  ``SHOW_BUILD_STATUS``: If True, will show pull request status icons in
   the slack message. Defaults to True.

-  ``SUCCESS_EMOJI``: Slack emoji name to show for pull requests with the
   'success' status. Defaults to 'âœ“'. Can be a slack emoji string like
   ':white_check_mark:'

-  ``PENDING_EMOJI``: Slack emoji name to show for pull requests with the
   'pending' status. Defaults to ':large_orange_diamond:'. Can be a slack
   emoji string like ':large_orange_diamond:'

-  ``FAILURE_EMOJI``: Slack emoji name to show for pull requests with the
   'failure' status. Defaults to ':x:'.Can be a slack emoji string like
   ':x:'

Its recommended to set up custom slack emoji such as the ones `here
<https://github.com/markddavidoff/icons/tree/master/build_status/>`_ as
the ones that come with slack and unicode ones are not very pretty.

Example
~~~~~~~

.. code:: bash

    $ ORGANIZATION="orgname" SLACK_API_TOKEN="token" GITHUB_API_TOKEN="token" slack-pull-reminder

Cronjob
~~~~~~~

As slack-pull-reminder only runs once and exits, it's recommended to run
it regularly using for example a cronjob.

Example that runs slack-pull-reminder every day at 10:00:

.. code:: bash

    0 10 * * * ORGANIZATION="orgname" SLACK_API_TOKEN="token" GITHUB_API_TOKEN="token" slack-pull-reminder
